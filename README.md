## 🌟 Vision

**T1D Parent Connect** aims to empower parents of children with Type 1 Diabetes by combining practical management tools with emotional support and community resources. We believe that supporting the caregivers is crucial to improving outcomes for children living with T1D.

## 🔍 The Problem

Parents of children with Type 1 Diabetes face unique challenges:

- Managing unpredictable blood glucose levels around the clock
- Navigating the emotional impact of a chronic condition
- Coordinating care between home, school, and healthcare providers
- Finding reliable information and support networks

While many diabetes management apps exist, most focus solely on the technical aspects of care. Few address the holistic needs of parents, particularly the emotional and community support dimensions that are critical to sustaining daily care.

## 🎯 Core Features

This prototype focuses on three essential pillars:

### 📊 Simplified Glucose Tracking
- Basic blood glucose, insulin, and meal logging
- Visual patterns and trend identification
- Customizable alerts and reminders

### 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Community Support
- Discussion forums organized by topics and age groups
- Experience sharing and peer support
- Resource recommendations from the community

### 📚 Knowledge Hub
- Curated educational resources for different stages of the T1D journey
- Quick-reference guides for common scenarios
- School and childcare resources
